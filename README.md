[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_ZH_CN.md)  

**Zalith Launcher 2** is a newly designed launcher for **Android devices** tailored for [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/). The project uses [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/tree/v3_openjdk/app_pojavlauncher/src/main/jni) as its core launching engine and features a modern UI built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Design 3**.
We are currently building our official website [zalithlauncher.cn](https://zalithlauncher.cn)  
Additionally, we are aware that a third-party website has been set up using the name ‚ÄúZalith Launcher,‚Äù appearing to be official. Please note: **this site was not created by us**. It exploits the name to display ads for profit. We **do not participate in, endorse, or trust** such content.  
Please stay vigilant and **protect your personal privacy**!  

> [!WARNING]
> This project is **completely separate** from [ZalithLauncher](https://github.com/ZalithLauncher/ZalithLauncher).  
> The project is in an early development stage. Many features are still under construction‚Äîstay tuned for updates!

## üåê Language and Translation Support

### Zalith Launcher 2 currently supports the following two languages:

* **English** (default)
* **Simplified Chinese**

These two languages are **officially maintained by the project and guaranteed for completeness**.

### Community-supported languages for Zalith Launcher 2:

We welcome the community to contribute translations for other languages!

* **Turkish** - by Star1xr

### üìå Why Only English and Simplified Chinese?

* The project is **internationally aimed**, so English is used as the default language; however, since the developer is not a native English speaker, the English content relies heavily on AI-assisted translation, which may contain minor inaccuracies.
   * If you have any objections to the English translation, please provide the line number of the translated content along with your feedback~ [`values/strings.xml`](./ZalithLauncher/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)
* The developer [@MovTery](https://github.com/MovTery) is based in China, and can guarantee the quality and completeness of the **Simplified Chinese** translation.
* Due to resource limitations, the completeness of other language translations cannot be guaranteed at this time and will depend on community contributions.

### ‚úçÔ∏è How to Contribute Translations?

If you would like to see your native language supported in the project, feel free to submit translation files via Pull Requests. Please follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Default Language Files**

   * Since the English content was translated with AI assistance, please refer primarily to the most accurate Simplified Chinese description.:  
     [`values-zh-rCN/strings.xml`](./ZalithLauncher/src/main/res/values-zh-rCN/strings.xml)
2. **Create Your Language Resource Directory**

   * For example, Traditional Chinese: `values-zh-rTW`, French: `values-fr`, Japanese: `values-ja`, etc.
3. **Translate the Content**

   * Translate the contents of `strings.xml` into your language, and make sure to keep all `name` attributes unchanged.
   * It is recommended to refer to the official Simplified Chinese version:
     [`strings.xml`](./ZalithLauncher/src/main/res/values-zh-rCN/strings.xml)
4. **Submit a Pull Request**

   * In the PR description, specify which language has been added and clarify the translation method (e.g., "human translation").

### ‚úÖ Translation Guidelines and Notes

* **Do not use machine translation** (e.g., Google Translate, DeepL, etc.) to directly generate translations.
* Keep professional terminology and follow platform-specific expressions (e.g., Minecraft-related terms).
* Do not translate punctuation marks or key instructions (e.g., "Shift", "Ctrl", etc.).
* Ensure string integrity (placeholders like `%1$s`, `\n`, and similar formats must be retained).
* Please note that special characters in XML need to be escaped, such as `<` should be written as `&lt;`, and `&` should be written as `&amp;`.
   * For escape rules, refer to the [official XML escape rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#syntax).

Thank you to all the language contributors for making Zalith Launcher 2 more multilingual and global! üéâ
